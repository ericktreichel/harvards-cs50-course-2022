# harvards-cs50-course-2022

Repository following my projects within the 2022's CS50x course from Harvard University - covering 11 weeks plus a final project, where I will apply part of the knowledge acquired.

CS50 is an eleven weeks course designed to teach us about computer science and specially to teach us how to learn a new language and apply the general concepts learned from CS on them, for example.
The first weeks cover the basis of CS using the C language as support, and the following weeks are about Python, SQL, HTML/CSS5/JavaScript, Flask and Emoji (a week grouping different topics and subejects), respectively.
After the 11 weeks the challenge is to build a new project from scratch applying the knowledge acquired, following specific guidelines from CS50's team.
